## Implementation Guide

### Checking Permissions in Components
```tsx
import { useRBAC } from '@/contexts/RBACContext';

function UserManagement() {
  const { hasPermission } = useRBAC();
  
  if (!hasPermission('user.view')) {
    return <AccessDenied />;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      {hasPermission('user.create') && (
        <CreateUserButton />
      )}
      <UserList />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using Permission Gates
```tsx
import PermissionGate from '@/components/rbac/PermissionGate';

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PermissionGate permission="analytics.view">
        <AnalyticsSection />
      </PermissionGate>
      
      <PermissionGate 
        permission="user.manage"
        fallback={<div>Contact administrator for access</div>}
      >
        <UserManagementSection />
      </PermissionGate>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Role Assignment

### Automatic Assignment
New users are automatically assigned the "Employee" role upon creation.

### Manual Assignment
Administrators can assign additional roles through the user management interface.

### Role Inheritance
Roles can inherit permissions from other roles:
- Manager inherits all Agent permissions
- Admin inherits all Manager permissions

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security
- Permissions are checked on every component render
- API calls validate permissions server-side
- Sensitive data is hidden based on permissions

### Backend Integration
- JWT tokens include user permissions
- API endpoints validate permissions before processing
- Database queries are filtered by user permissions

### Session Management
- Permissions are refreshed on login
- Session expiry forces re-authentication
- Permission changes take effect on next login

## Troubleshooting

### User Cannot Access Feature
1. Check user's assigned roles
2. Verify role has required permissions
3. Confirm permission names match exactly
4. Check for typos in permission strings

### Permission Not Working
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify API responses include correct permissions

### Role Assignment Issues
1. Ensure user has admin permissions
2. Check role exists and is active
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Review audit logs for conflicts

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Logging
All permission-related actions are logged:
- Role assignments and removals
- Permission grants and revocations
- Access attempts (successful and failed)
- Administrative actions

### Compliance Reports
Regular reports are generated showing:
- User access patterns
- Permission usage statistics
- Role distribution across organization
- Security incidents and resolutions

### Data Retention
- Audit logs retained for 1 year
- Permission history maintained indefinitely
- User access logs kept for 90 days
- Security incidents archived permanently
